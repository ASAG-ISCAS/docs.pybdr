# Functional

Several auxiliary modules provided for supporting the computation.

## Boundary

+ interval boundary as interval
+ interval boundary as zonotope
+ polytope boundary as interval
+ polytope boundary as zonotope
+ zonotope boundary as zonotope

## Convert

+ from points to interval
+ from points to polytope
+ from interval to zonotope
+ from interval to polytope
+ from zonotope to interval

## Enclose

+ enclose zonotopes by zonotope

## Partition

+ split interval into cells as interval
+ split interval into cells as zonotope
+ split zonotope into cells as interval
+ split zonotope into cells as zonotope
