# Container

We also provide a data class container named `Reachable` to organize the general reachable results. `Set` used to
characterize a set composed of simple geometry objects.

## Set

+ `geo` geometry object approximating the exact set
+ `err` error

## Reachable

+ `tpt` time point time
+ `tps` time point set, list of sets
+ `tit` time interval time
+ `tis` time interval set, list of sets
